# Cloud Native Python Example Application

## Scope

We wanted to create a demo flask app to work on k8s, and OpenShift.

## Prow

I have a prow instance monitoring this now:
<http://52.116.51.146:30302/>

The [plugins](http://52.116.51.146:30302/plugins) enabled are:
- size
- assign
- cat

This is me testing the pre-and-post jobs.
